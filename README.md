## Questions for the analysis
1. What is the most streamed track on Spotify during the selected period? 
2. Which months have the highest average streams, and how does this trend change over the year?
3. What is the distribution of streams by release year, and how have music trends evolved over time?
4. Which day of the week sees the highest stream count on average?
5. What are the characteristics (energy, speechiness, danceability) of the top streamed track, and how do these attributes compare to others?

## Key takeaways
1. Blinding Lights is the most streamed track, with over 3.7 billion streams, reflecting its massive global popularity.
2. Friday has the highest streaming activity, likely due to new music releases and weekend listening habits.
3. September and October stand out as months with the highest average streams, possibly due to new album drops or holiday season preparation.
4. Streams are concentrated on newer tracks, with a sharp increase after the rise of digital platforms around the year 2000.
5. Popular songs tend to have high energy and danceability, indicating listener preferences for upbeat music.

## Recommendations
1. Artists could target Friday releases to maximize initial stream potential.
2. Marketing campaigns should be concentrated in late summer and fall (August to October) to capitalize on peak streaming months.
3. Content creators might focus on producing high-energy, danceable tracks to align with the characteristics of the most streamed music. 
4. Spotify could explore boosting engagement on days with lower stream counts (e.g., Monday, Tuesday) through curated playlists or promotions.
