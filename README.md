It enables stakeholders to monitor key metrics, such as average delivery times and salesperson performance, to enhance decision-making and operational efficiency.

## About the dataset

The primary datasets used in this project are Country.csv, Product.csv, SalesPerson.csv and Shipment.csv which contains information about individual shipments handled by different sales person.

## Data Model

![Data Model](https://github.com/KCMcafe15/Logistics-Analysis-Project/blob/96eb0250e964a8b3db3fa5d2f82272c92abdf1cd/img/data%20model.JPG)

## Questions for the analysis
1. What is the total revenue generated from shipments?
2. How many shipments were completed successfully?
3. What is the average delivery time?
4. Which product category generated the most revenue?
5. Who is the top-performing salesperson in terms of total shipments handled?

## Key takeaways
1. The total revenue generated is **$2M**, indicating strong logistics activity.
2. **3K** shipments were completed, representing **62%** of all shipments, which suggests a high success rate.
3. The average delivery time is **10 days**, providing a standard measure of operational efficiency.
4. **Electronics** contributed the largest portion of revenue at **68%**, highlighting its dominance in the market.
5. **Bonnie Lucero** is the top performer, handling **286** total shipments with a relatively low return rate, indicating high efficiency.

## Recommendations

1. Given that **68% of revenue** comes from electronics, consider prioritizing resources and marketing efforts toward this category to further boost revenue.   
2. With an average delivery time of **10 days**, explore optimizing supply chain processes, especially in regions like Australia, to reduce delays.
3. Since **4.96% of shipments** are returned, identify the reasons behind returns and implement strategies (e.g., quality checks, better product descriptions) to lower this percentage.
4. Utilize high-performing salespeople like **Bonnie Lucero** and **Kayla Banks** for training or mentorship programs to elevate the performance of others.
5. Countries with longer delivery times, such as **Australia** and **Japan**, could benefit from localized logistics improvements to enhance customer satisfaction and increase repeat business.
